# Base — Hidden Buy Wall Detector

Most tools show you pumps after they happen.  
This one shows you the **invisible hand** building the pump.

Detects when someone buys **$75k+ in one swap** but price moves less than 2%.

That only happens when:
- A whale is eating the entire sell wall
- Limit buys are stacked deep below spot
- Smart money is accumulating silently

## Run

```bash
python base_hidden_buy_wall.py
